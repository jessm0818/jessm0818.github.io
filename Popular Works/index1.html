  <div> Nara creates his works directly and freely, without a go-to method. 
    He uses soft-hued, pastel colors with bold lines, as seen in anime characters in popular culture as well as contrasting images, colors, and emotions. 
    Nara stimulates distressing feelings through the subjects of his work through nightmarish features.
        His work is displayed with various mediums (painting, sculpture, large scale installations, etc)</div>
