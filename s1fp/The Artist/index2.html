            <div class="paragraph">Yoshitomo Nara is an internationally renowned contemporary artist. He is known for depicting small children in solitary settings. His aim is to create his works directly and freely so that his works are understood universally.
            Unlike other artists who have a consistent creative process, Nara confessed that he does not have a go-to method. In multiple interviews, he has said that he often paints many different images over each other on one canvas until he feels 
            a connection with one.</div>

            <div class="paragraph">It is important to point out that he often uses soft hued pastel colors but also sometimes uses bold, cartoonish lines. The use of the colors give his works a different vibe.</div>
