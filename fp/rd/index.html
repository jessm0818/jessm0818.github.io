          Ulises Carrión redefines the concept of mail art by focusing on the distinction between ‘mail’ and ‘art’ and argues that mail art utilizes the Postal System as its support, like how traditional art may use a canvas or paper. He emphasizes that even though the post system serves as the means of distribution, it is not the medium itself since the artist controls the creation of the ‘mail piece’ but not the system that delivers it. Carrión critiques the misconception that mail art is just about creating postcards but stresses that true mail art integrates the postal system as an essential element of the work. His perspective challenged me to view mail art as an intricate process where the act of mailing the art is a crucial part of the artistic process. I thought it was interesting that he brought up how the significance of receiving a letter changes depending on who it is, like a lover or the bank.
          </p> <p>
      1. How can mail art be seen as a precursor to modern digital forms of communication and artist expression (for example, in social media or digital art platforms)? </p> <p>
      2. How might the unpredictability (delays, lost mail, delivered to the wrong place) of the postal system contribute or diminish the unique value of a mail art piece/the artist's original intent for the mail art piece?

      I found it interesting how Schwulst mentioned a “self-reflexive feedback loop” which highlights how the energy and intention we invest into building a site can shape not only the site’s identity but also our own. For me, the idea that was put into my perspective was that as website creators, the process of designing and curating a website can reflect our personal values and interests which in turn influences how we see ourselves and how we present our identity to the world/internet web. Additionally, I really loved the metaphor Schwulst used to describe a website as a plant that grows in its own way, the process of curating a website, as well as growing a plant, cannot be rushed. On the other hand, Édouard discusses the idea of making a digital space that fosters imagination and exploration to encourage people to shape their own environment to what they want that holds personal meaning. With the given structure, digital spaces can either enhance creativity or overwhelm the mind, so both argue for more deliberate interactions with the internet than just passive consumption. </p>
      <p>
      1. How do you think our relationship with the internet/how we use it would change if we were to create personal websites rather than use social media platforms (of huge corporations like facebook or instagram)? </p>
        <p>
      2. How can creating digital spaces that encourage imagination and exploration change the way we interact with the internet? Would this actually lead to more meaningful online experiences? </p>

      It's fascinating that the Geocities archive preserved a snapshot of the internet's early days because we are able to see how digitally, things changed/aged over time. I thought it was interesting that it ended with the idea of the web "getting old" because it challenges our perception of the internet as a space that is renewing itself/constantly evolving. The creative, free spirit in internet users still is evident today and the influence that Geocities may have had persists. The concept of "Under Construction" pages caught my eye because unlike the polished and static websites we see today, these pages were more human in a way, embracing imperfection and potential rather than finality. It could have been because back then, it was a space to build, experiment and grow, but nowadays what I see is a pressure for things to be complete and finalized, since I never really ever see incomplete websites. </p>
      <p>
      1. What do you think we've lost or gained about the web since the deletion of Geocities? </p>
        <p>
      2. How do the themed neighborhoods in Geocities like SoHo or Heartland compare to how we organize in digital communities today? </p>

      A main takeaway I had from this reading is that the many parts of a work are not equal to its whole even though we perceive something first as a whole. Every small element in a design contributes to a bigger message, but each small element may be unique. Since I have been watching a lot of animation films recently, I was reminded of it when Wertheimer questioned the difference between “real” movement and “apparent,” but when Wertheimer realized that what mattered was the whole experience, I related it to how each singular frame in animation contributes to a cohesive narrative and movement. Reinfurt emphasizes the importance of process and collaboration, which shows in the way animators meticulously plan each frame, considering the timing, pacing, and transitions. Therefore, the concept of “gestalt,” where our perception of the whole is different from just adding up its parts, makes me consider how individual parts, which may be distinct from one another, play together to communicate for the bigger picture. </p>
        
      <p>
      1. Since Reinfurt explored a few logos, what role does the concept of “gestalt” play in the effectiveness of a logo design? </p>
        <p>
      2. What does the “wait cursor” that targeted the interaction problem of “perceived responsiveness” (to indicate a computer was loading) tell us about the impact of subtle design elements as we perceive and interact with technology? </p>

      Ludovico and Cramer explore the intersection of digital and print media in the post digital age where publications in print are still relevant even though digital platforms exist, an accessible method to view media. I thought it was interesting how they wanted us to view the two as complementary, the thought of print publications still being relevant hasn't really occurred to me in my head, even though I often see and ignore printed publications in stores/handed out to me and resort to using digital platforms to view media. Though digital media is more rapid and relevant in this age, print remains our physical carrier of information. Our reading highlights Ulises Carrión's belief that books are not merely object that holds content but rather objects that can transform depending on how they are produced and consumed. I see this idea as a challenge to traditional books as static objects, it can evolve based on the reader's interaction with it, and if it includes QR codes, as the book is an evolving medium. I feel like this can apply to other print media as well. </p>
      
      <p>
      1. The use of QR codes can create interactive and personalized experiences. How can QR codes reshape the way we interact with printed books, magazines, and other media (printed media aspect)? Especially when you use your phone to scan it and it opens a tab (digital aspect)?  </p>
      <p>
      2. If we integrate digital and print media into academic publishing/learning in the classroom, how would these medias influence the future of education? </p>

      I think it's interesting how Cokylat and Finnegan frame alt-text as an artistic practice, which made me reflect on how I use alt-text in real life, especially on platforms like Instagram. Usually when I upload photos, I don’t even think about how my descriptions impact accessibility. But considering alt-text as poetry (where we bring attention to language, economy of words, and even an experimental spirit) has made me rethink how I describe my images. I can be more mindful and craft something more engaging, contributing to a more accessible and enriching experience for users who rely on screen readers. I thought it was very insightful that it was mentioned that artists who work visually should acknowledge the barriers for certain audiences to engage with their work. </p>
      
       <p>
      1. How does viewing alt-text as a form of poetry change your perception of its role in a digital space?  </p>
      <p>
      2. What challenges may arise in balancing creativity with clarity when trying to write alt-text in situations like enhancing user experience? </p>

      I thought it was mind blowing that Nasser's piece connects traditional concepts of programming languages to larger systemic issues like the lack of diversity in production and graphic design firms. Nasser highlights how most programming languages are rooted in English syntax/the latin alphabet, which reflects an invisible bias towards Western norms. This is something that I never really struggled with or realized was a problem, especially with all the frustrations that Nasser has faced trying to put Arabic letters in apps or with Github. Though I do not know much about computer programming, a takeaway from this reading would be that “programming is always a social and collaborative act.” </p>
      
        <p>
      1. Do education systems perpetuate or challenge Western programming languages and how can they adapt to become more inclusive? </p>
      <p>
      2. If we integrate non-English programming languages, how would that reshape the way technology is taught and developed globally? </p>

      I think it was interesting that Duvall chose to use a well known figure like Mickey Mouse to challenge the viewer's perception of modernism. This goes to show that the most classic symbols that we see in mass culture can be reframed and left up to interpretation within an artistic context. By looking at other pieces of works that distort and deconstruct Mickey's familiar shape, Duvall made me think about how the imagery has been infiltrated, and how it impacted my perception of the work. I liked this quote from the reading: "...chaos to these signifiers, the signified is unclear, left to the interpretation of the receiver." I thought it was also interesting that Bauhaus designs were talked about because I learned about their goal in creating simple, minimalistic designs in other classes. </p>
      
      <p>
      1. How does the equation that "surface + sign = a work of graphic design" shape our understanding of what makes a design visually and conceptually effective to a viewer? </p>
      <p>
      2. Do textures and layers affect your interpretation of an artwork's depth and meaning? </p>

      I thought it was cool how Frenkel’s String Games (1974) was a bridge between early video technology and traditional storytelling. Frankel’s use of teleconferencing technology to stage a Cat’s Cradle inspired performance in Montreal and Toronto seemed like it was ahead of its time. She creatively uses gestures, symbols, and strings as virtual “fingers” to connect the participants across cities, and it gives it a poetic sense of loss of physical proximity because it is replaced by a digital connection instead. I feel as if this work and early engagement with technology was the early blueprint to her later work like the Body Missing website. I thought her “open-ended outcomes” to her art were critical.  </p>
      
      <p>
      1. How does Frenkel’s use of the letter X (in String Games) challenge the way we perceive presence/absence in digital interactions? </p>
        
        <p>
      2. Frenkel emphasizes absence and the “loss” multiple times in digital memory making (how we create, store, share memories through media and technology). How does this influence our understanding of our interactions with platforms like social media?  </p>

      Something that stood out to me was Rob Horning's state of "the new boredom" that describes how we consume media and participate in collective experiences like livestreams. There is an unpredictable nature to lives where it is a continuous feed, and we just watch in anticipation of a surprise or disruption which keeps us engaged. This also offers a communal space, since audiences have a shared reactions and are emotionally invested in real time but there is a chance that these spaces turn into politicized arenas, where judgment, bias, hate speech, and other societal issues may get into the mix. This made me think of the many livestreams everywhere in media (Tik tok, Instagram, Youtube, Twitch, so much more). Soulellis' contrast with the traditional "post" with the continuous and immersive "feed" was quite interesting with all the images and explanations. </p>
      
        <p>
      1. How can individuals resist/disrupt the "smooth flow" of feeds (driven by the algorithm) to reclaim agency over media consumption? </p>
      <p>
      2. Do you think there is a state of deindividuation when watching streams? </p>

      I really enjoyed the illustrations and how the ending reflects a significant transformation in Gem's mindset and priorities. After nearly installing The Way software, she chooses to cancel it and instead seek an opportunity to volunteer, her decision showing her realization that meaningful change arises from active participation and connection with others and not from passive consumption of technology/reliance on technology being the solution. Her act of volunteering embodies the phrase "Another world is possible," emphasizing that collective action can lead to a better future. I liked how there was also a glossary defining terms in the reading which are elements of how technology operates/how humans interact with it.  </p>
      
        <p>
      1. Because the phrase "Another world is possible" is central to the story's theme, how does Gem’s journey reflect this idea? </p>
      <p>
      2. If interfaces act as "boundaries" between humans and computers, how might future technological developments redefine this so called "boundary"? </p>

      Groys wrote, "Historically, literature and art were considered fields of fiction. Now I would argue that the use of the Internet as the main medium of production and distribution of art and literature leads to their defictionalization." This is fascinating to me because the way I interpret it is that the internet blurs boundaries that are between fiction and reality. Art online can feel just as grounded in reality and less separate from our everyday lives. This idea is compelling to me because it makes me wonder if the constant interaction we have with real events and the internet's immediateness/quickness are changing how we think about creativity and storytelling in our art and literature. </p>
      
        <p>
      1. Groys makes a distinction between art and art documentation. How does both impact that way we perceive and value it? Can documentation ever become "art" in its own right? </p>
        <p>
      2. How does the idea of archives as "machines for transporting the present into the future" change the way we understand art in shaping cultural memory? Do you think that art is timeless? </p>
