        I have been a huge fan of Yoshitomo Nara since high school. I first discovered his work online and ever since then, I have been following his works. I just find his artwork so interesting and I hope you do as well!

        Though I have not been to an exhibit with Nara's works, I have seen some of the items he is selling at the MoMa store in Soho, New York. I can't exactly justify the price, but maybe one day, I might buy it :)
